# Tools For Github

Here's a list of APIs that use the same URL structure as github and provide a tool for GitHub.

- gitingest.com - [get prompt-friendly codebase](https://gitingest.com)
- gitpodcast.com - [codebase to podcast](https://gitpodcast.com)
- uithub.com - [get prompt-friendly codebase (and API)](https://uithub.com)

To navigate to your desired page more easily, go from any 'github.com/_' url to 'forgithub.com/_' and you'll get **quick links**!

# Contributing

Please make a PR for any additional tools with the following requirements:

- follow the same structure in the README
- the tool must at least support the `/[owner]/[repo]/[page]/[brancg]/[...path]` url structure or a subset thereof
- bonus points if the tool exposes an `openapi.json` at its root
