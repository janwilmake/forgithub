# Tools For Github

Here's a list of APIs that use the same URL structure as github and provide a tool for GitHub. To easily navigate from any page on github to any of these tools, you can just prepend "for" to your URL and you'll get an overview with contextual redirects!

- gitingest.com - [get prompt-friendly codebase](https://gitingest.com)
- gitpodcast.com - [codebase to podcast](https://gitpodcast.com)
- uithub.com - [get prompt-friendly codebase (and API)](https://uithub.com)

# Contributing

Please make a PR for any additional tools with the following requirements:

- follow the same structure in the README
- the tool must at least support the `/[owner]/[repo]/[page]/[brancg]/[...path]` url structure or a subset thereof
- bonus points if the tool exposes an `openapi.json` at its root
