# GitHub Tools Powered By URL UX

Here's a list of tools that use the same URL structure as github enabling you to use it by just changing your url.

To navigate to your desired page more easily, go from any 'github.com/_' url to 'forgithub.com/_' and you'll get **quick links**! You can star your favorites, or after you remember them you can visit them directly.

# Contributing

Please make a PR for any additional tools with the following requirements:

- follow the same structure in the README
- the tool must at least support the `/[owner]/[repo]/[page]/[brancg]/[...path]` url structure or a subset thereof
- the tool should have a freemium business model and not require sign-in at first
- bonus points if the tool exposes an `openapi.json` at its root

# Why?

URL UX makes tools highly accessible. Since a lot of what devs do evolves around repos, I figured that's a good one to focus on. 'Repo to Anything' is the dream!
