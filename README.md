List of APIs that use the same URL structure as github and provide a tool for GitHub:

- https://uithub.com - get prompt-friendly codebase
- https://githus.com - static dashboard
- https://diff.forgithub.com - API to see diff (using compare URL structure)
- https://join.forgithub.com - cached data like issues, wiki, and actions

TODO:

Make this `index.html` be shown on any path (like ide) and add all links there that link through, so you can always discover more for github.
