# Highly Accessible Tools For Github

Here's a list of APIs that use the same URL structure as github and provide a tool for GitHub.

- gitingest.com - [get prompt-friendly codebase](https://gitingest.com)
- gitpodcast.com - [codebase to podcast](https://gitpodcast.com)
- bolt.new - [open in boltâ€¤new](https://bolt.new/github.com)
- github.dev - [VSCode in the browser](https://github.dev)
- uithub.com - [get prompt-friendly codebase (and API)](https://uithub.com)
- log.forgithub.com - [get last commits and contributor info](https://log.forgithub.com)

To navigate to your desired page more easily, go from any 'github.com/_' url to 'forgithub.com/_' and you'll get **quick links**!

# Contributing

Please make a PR for any additional tools with the following requirements:

- follow the same structure in the README
- the tool must at least support the `/[owner]/[repo]/[page]/[brancg]/[...path]` url structure or a subset thereof
- the tool should have a freemium business model and not require sign-in at first
- bonus points if the tool exposes an `openapi.json` at its root

# Why?

Easy. That's why

Because URL UX is fantastic. 'Repo to Anything' is the dream!
